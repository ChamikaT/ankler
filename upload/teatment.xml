Sports massage for surrounding muscles on as weekly basis. continue with strength training as above but start to include hopping and bounding exercises.  The athlete should now be ready to gradually return to full sports specific training and then competition.</treatment>
        <treatment> A knee support or a strapping / taping techniques may provide extra support on return to full training.  however do not become reliant on this. It will weaken the joint. Use initially for Confidence building.</treatment>
